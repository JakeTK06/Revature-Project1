# Acceptance Test Summary
## User Story 1 - Score: 3
### As a new user I want to open an account with the Planetarium so I can save my celestial findings
#### Is the intended use of the service intuitive? Score: 3
- The service is intuitive to use. There is a clear registration link on the login page that will take the user to create an account with an input box for a username and password along with a create button. There could be slight improvements which is why I marked it down one point because account registration could be more intuitive by listing the requirements for username and password to be valid so that the user is not suprised when an alert pops up. 

#### Is the service easy to use? Score: 3
- The service is easy to use. The steps to create an account were self explanitory and the alerts do a good job of letting the user know when there is a misstep in the processs. The only time that it fails is when a user tries to create an account with a username that already exits. In this case no alert pops up and it can be confusing as to why the account is not being created. 

#### Does the service inspire confidence? Score: 2
- The service inspires some confidence but not a lot. This is because there is an alert missing for when a user tries to create an account with a username that already exists. This is a pretty common scenario that could occur so if there is something broken with this part it seems likely that another mistake could have been made when building the user registration functionality. 

#### Is the service pleaseing to look at? Score: 1
- The service is not pleasing to look at. Starting with the login screen the registration button is tiny, hard to read and easy to miss. Then once you get to the registration page it is very uninviting, the whole page is a black background with a dark gray box to input account information. Along with all this the font is very boring, and the Create account title is off center with the input boxes which gives an unprofessional look to the input box. The service would be much more pleasing to look at with some warmer more inviting colors, and a font that is not the standard Arial. 


## User Story 2 - Score: 3
### As a user I want to securely access my account so I can interact with the Planetarium in a secure environment
#### Is the intended use of the service intuitive? Score: 4
- The service is very intuitive to use. Users should have no issue with the login functionality of the website, there is a very straight forward form that asks for username and password along with a login button. All of the alerts pop up correctly when inputing invalid information which makes it easy for the user to figureout if they have input incorrect login credentials. 

#### Is the service easy to use? Score: 4
- The service is very easy to use. A user should have no problem logging in to use the planetarium application. The form to submit login info is simple and effective. 

#### Does the service inspire confidence? Score: 4
- The service does a very good job at inspiring confidence. Passwords are hidden when they are being typed in which gives users a sense of security. Also when trying to access the homepage directly without logging in users will be denied access which provides another layer of confidence that users information is being handled securly by the application.

#### Is the service pleaseing to look at? Score: 1
- The application is not pleasing to look at. There is a very uninviting dark background along with a dark gray input box. The login box also has standard arial font with the "Planetarium Login" title offcenter from the input boxes which can seem somewhat rushed together. The login page appears rushed and uninviting. 

## User Story 3 - Score: 4
### As a user I want to see my planets and moons added to the Planetarium so I can track my findings
#### Is the intended use of the service intuitive? Score: 4
- The service is very intuitive. All the planets and moons that are added by a user can be seen. The scroll bar that appears when the list get bigger makes it clear that you can scroll to see more of your planets and moons. 

#### Is the service easy to use? Score: 4
- The service is very easy to use. Once a user is logged in all of the users planets and moons are there for them to view. All the user needs to do is scroll to see all the celestial objects they have added. 

#### Does the service inspire confidence? Score: 4
- The service inspires a good deal of confidence. Once users have planets and moons added they can see all of the relevant information they submitted when created and can have confidence that the application will show all future moons or planets added as well. The user can gain even more confidence know that logged out users cannot access the home page and that thier planets can only be seen by them. 

#### Is the service pleaseing to look at? Score: 2
- The service is somewhat pleasing to look at. There is a nice welcome message for the user and the galaxy background makes the home page more inviting and fit in more with the theme of a planetarium application. Where the home page falls short is how boring the display of the planets is. Every thing is listed is a very small font relative to the planet pictures and in a thin column. 

## User Story 4 - Score: 3
### As a user I want to add new planets and moons to the Planetarium so I can update my findings
#### Is the intended use of the service intuitive? Score: 2
- The service for adding new planets and moons is not that intuitive. There is no clear instructions on how to add a planet or moon to your database, the select option does not come across as useful for adding initially because it is inline with the delete input. It is also not clear that the choose file button is for images, a user could think that it is for uploading a pdf of information about said planet. 

#### Is the service easy to use? Score: 3
- The service is easy to use once it gets figured out. All of the inputs and submit button are easy to use. Where it falls short is for the file uploading there isn't an alert that pops up when the file is an invalid type which leads to nothing happening on screen and can be confusing. 

#### Does the service inspire confidence? Score: 3 
- The service inspires a good amount of confidence. The service appears to work as expected and gives confidence to the user that planets are being added securly. The only issue that could cause some uncertainty is that there is no alert for an invalid file type and nothing happens. This could lead the user to think it isn't being handled properly and casuing issues in the backend. 

#### Is the service pleaseing to look at? Score: 1
- The adding planets and moons service is not that pleasing to look at on its own. It gets somewhat jumbled together with the delete service and all of the inputs for moon especially look somewhat jumbled together. It could be improved by having a button to add planets and moons then have a popup for them each where users can input information there, then the homepage would not be as cluttered. 

## User Story 5 - Score: 3
### As a user I want to remove planets and moons from the Planetarium so I can correct my findings
#### Is the intended use of the service intuitive? Score: 3
- The service for removing planets and moons is inuitive. The select option for planet and moon is right next to the delete input making it clear it has an impace on it. The input has a clear description listed to input the name of celestial body to be deleted, and the delete button is next to the input making it clear that it submits the form. The only thing that could be slightly unituitve is what happens to moons owned by a planet when a planet gets deleted. 

#### Is the service easy to use? Score: 4
- The service is very easy to use. The select option has both options ready to go, the text box is easy to fill in and the delete button is visible and clickable. It is a very easy process to delete planets and moons. 

#### Does the service inspire confidence? Score: 4
- The service inspires lots of confidece. All of the correct warnings pop up when deleting planets and moons that don't exist and valid info correctly deletes planets and moons, as well as the moons that are owned by deleted planets. The user should have full confidence in the remove functionality. 

#### Is the service pleaseing to look at? Score: 1
- The service is not pleasing to look at. There is one long input box that is somewhat ugly as well as the delete input boxes being somewhat mashed together with the adding service which on a smaller screen can make it harder to figure out what goes with what.
